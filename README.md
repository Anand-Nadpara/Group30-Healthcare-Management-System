Here we are using an idea for continuous monitoring of a patient's health conditions. The health care scheme is focused on the measurement and monitoring of various biological parameters of a patient's body like heart rate, oxygen saturation level in the blood, and temperature, where a doctor can continuously monitor the patient's condition. And any kind of emergency doctor will get immediately notified about the situation.
